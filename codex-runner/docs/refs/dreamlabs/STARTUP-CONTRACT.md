# Pinned Dream SDK startup and observation contract

Verified against official dreamlabs-client1.0.0 and dreamlabs1.0.0 wheel sources used by this integration. This is a source-derived reference; it does not measure a production run.

- `dream/facade.py:DreamClient.__init__` reads the configured credential and binds endpoints; its contract says it sends no request or model session.
- `DreamClient.policy` opens a policy and creates a new observation window. `dream/client_ik.py:ClientIK.__init__` initializes the local solver. For EEF trajectory mode it warms the tick solve synchronously and starts trajectory compilation on a background thread; forward-kinematics initialization is also local. A duration around this whole policy call includes its setup and cannot automatically be called remote model inference.
- `set_observation` retains the newest measured state and a timestamped camera window. The SDK requires monotonic observation timestamps within an episode.
- `get_action` sends the latest state/window and creates or continues a stateful model session. Its EEF conversion/IK uses measured joint state and the commanded chunk anchor. A pre-Home prediction cannot be treated as a fresh post-Home prediction just by changing a flag or timestamp.
- The shared Astra/Codex HomeScene protocol uses actual saved Home observations and strict scene/lease/configuration/freshness checks plus bind/discard hooks. Dream does not implement that protocol. Ordinary SDK setup may overlap native Home after lease grant. ClawMetry opts into synthetic solver preparation before queue admission; live Dream prediction in both modes remains after confirmed Home and fresh state/images.

## Resident solver and episode reuse

SDK1.0.0 `DreamClient.reset_episode()` delegates to `PolicyClient.reset_episode()` before clearing its `_window`. The documented contract ends the remote session and chunk blending without constructing another policy or IK solver. `PolicyClient` refuses a concurrent reset during get_action; therefore the resident manager drains its single in-flight reply before resetting and handing ownership to another visitor. It never resets concurrently with inference. The SDK window's clear operation empties the observation, frame rings, recent timestamps and collection schedule. `_record=False` continues to disable background recording.

Two prepared policies in one process retain their respective checkpoint metadata/embodiment checks and static IK configuration. Only the documented episode-reset operation crosses visitor boundaries. Checkpoint configuration is not rewritten and no native motion, feedback or Home logic changes. The SDK's pinned `_policy._ik.traj_ready` event is read during initial preparation to ensure background trajectory compilation has completed; an absent/incompatible event fails preparation instead of reporting ready.

Each wire command is handled in its own function scope; reset/release replaces outer command references. Before lending again, every prepared client has been reset successfully, the shared input timestamp is cleared, and no previous request result can be read as a new visitor's response. A failed cleanup or broken transport destroys the process. Credential file changes also invalidate prepared readiness.


## Both trajectory kernel structures

SDK1.0.0 `dream_ik/solver.py:ChunkIK.solve_traj` supplies Python `None` or the
arm-base array to the JAX-jitted `_solve_traj` kernel. Its synthetic startup
warmup exercises only the branch selected by those warmup targets. The two
argument structures compile separately; `traj_ready` alone does not establish
that both are prepared. Exact-SDK synthetic probes confirmed compilation on a
later switch to the arm-coupled branch.

After `traj_ready`, `remote_yam.dream_ik_preparation` captures the pinned SDK's
kernel arguments from a synthetic 48-row rest-pose solve, restores the original
function binding, and executes both base-argument forms. Materializing each
result waits for compilation and execution. Both checkpoints complete this
preparation before `fully_ready` is returned; preparation errors fail readiness.
No model request or robot observation is used, all synthetic results are
discarded, and solver weights, joint limits, speed caps and runtime branch
selection stay as configured by the SDK. This depends on SDK1.0.0's private
kernel signature and must be revalidated on SDK upgrades.

The October20 incident trace establishes an IK timeout following a successful
HTTP response, while steering was still queued. It does not retain the target
poses needed to identify that historical solve's branch. Preparing both forms
closes a verified coverage gap; it does not prove the exact low-level cause of
that particular timeout or establish successful physical steering.

## Passive IK diagnostics, October20,2026

Pinned SDK1.0.0 `ChunkIK.solve_traj` first calls its per-tick `solve`, checks
`_interarm_distance`, and calls `_solve_traj` with either None or the arm-base
array. Diagnostics observe those boundaries as ik_seed, ik_clearance,
ik_kernel, and enclosing ik_trajectory. Kernel rows, arm count and actual
independent/coupled selection are retained. The wrapper waits on the existing
kernel result immediately before the SDK's existing NumPy materialization;
it never changes the objective, arguments, returned objects or graph outputs.

JAX0.7.1 authoritative installed `jax/_src/compiler.py`:
compile_or_get_cached covers the compilation/cache path; backend_compile_and_load
identifies actual backend compilation; _cache_read returns (executable or None,
compile time or None). Numeric hit/miss and separate durations distinguish
persistent cache reads from backend work. No module IR, cache keys, filenames,
code, arbitrary diagnostics or solver payload enters sdk-trace.jsonl.

Boundary events include process CPU seconds and wall duration. CPU time sums
threads in this process; it is not per-thread CPU or an exclusive solver cost.
The existing five-second background monitor adds bounded fixed numeric OS
samples: process RSS, available memory, load, CPU/steal deltas and their sample
window, pressure averages and cumulative cgroup throttling where supported.
These observations alone do not prove scheduling or memory caused a stall.

One kernel still active after five seconds may enqueue one private numerical
replay case for a background writer (one case per worker lifetime,2MiB archive
limit,128numeric arrays maximum). Sampling cadence means capture can occur up
to a further monitor interval later. Archive and metadata are0600 and stay in
the private worker directory. Only numeric solver inputs, fixed SDK
configuration, source hashes, shapes/branch and JAX weak-type information are
saved. There are no images, prompt text, credentials, user names, Python
objects/pickle or source archives. Original input references are released after
the one background job. Failures drop diagnostics and retain fixed counters.

Exact-SDK synthetic verification compared bitwise-identical original and
instrumented outputs, replayed the archived numerical case exactly, and
exercised actual compiler/cache hooks with a new synthetic row shape. It makes
no claim about the cause of earlier production stalls or physical readiness.

Tracing is installed during configuration, before both-form startup preparation.
The preparation helper uses Python's documented `inspect.unwrap` protocol to
follow `functools.wraps` back to the original bound SDK method, then finds its
module-global kernel binding. Inspecting `__func__` directly on the tracing
function breaks this startup order. The regression installs real diagnostics
before preparation; exact-SDK validation repeats both-form preparation with
the diagnostics installed, retaining the same kernel arguments and results.

## Per-visitor worker readiness

The November10 hosted trial accepted ten packets, then its first coupled48-row
solve exceeded the unchanged30-second prediction watchdog during local JAX
compilation, after HTTP had completed in0.608seconds. The semaphore-backed
per-visitor worker used plain `configure`, which did not call `prepare_ik`;
both-form preparation existed only in the resident `prime` and rate-change paths.

DreamAdapter now requests `fully_prepare=True` during initial configuration and
requires an explicit `fully_ready=True` receipt naming both trajectory variants.
The raw worker waits for the existing background readiness event and executes
the existing synthetic both-form warmup before acknowledging. A failed or
cancelled warmup cannot establish readiness. Resident workers retain their
existing preparation/reuse/reset semantics. Direct legacy configure callers may
omit the flag. Ordinary leased configuration retains its180-second bound and prediction retains its30-second bound. Calibration, model checkpoints, cadence, solver settings and motion limits stay unchanged. No timed-out prediction is replayed; synthetic preparation results are
discarded. Native progress and `sdk_full_preparation` timing describe the wait.


## ClawMetry preparation before queue admission

ClawMetry enables the trusted `dream_prepare_before_queue` hosting option. The
ordinary BluPe default remains lease-first preparation. This is constructor
configuration, not a browser-controlled request parameter.

The existing native pre-session lifecycle compiles both synthetic trajectory
variants before creating a robot session. Cold configuration has a360-second
budget within a600-second total preparation budget, including worker-slot wait.
It performs no camera/state observation collection, model prediction or robot
command. Stop/disconnect cancel it and release the single hosted worker slot.
Setup failure, incomplete readiness or changed calibration prevent queue entry.
The UI shows preparation and explicitly says that the run timer has not started.

After readiness, the runner joins the ordinary queue for the selected duration,
five minutes by default on ClawMetry. It checks the calibration again before
admission and after lease grant. Home/fresh feedback remain prerequisites for
actual prediction; prediction/recovery watchdogs and all motion checks remain
unchanged. Queue handshake failure or cancellation stops only the newly created
session. A stale preparation cannot reset a replacement run's Home state.

The launch attempt binds deferred session/episode attribution to its submitting
visitor. Preparation and the admitted run retain one interaction journal, so
public Activity, runner identity, history and assessment ownership continue
across the transition. No timed-out motion is retried or replayed.
